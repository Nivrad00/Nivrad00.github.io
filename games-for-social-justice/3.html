        <h2>Poverty, immigration, and war</h2>
        <p>War has long been a staple of video games. Yet, these games are usually told from the perspective of the powerful, whether it's a nation duking it out for territory or the U.S. military swooping in to stop terrorism. The games on this page attempt to tell the counterstory, of those who are economically and politically powerless, and thus put a human face on these often-debated issues.</p>
