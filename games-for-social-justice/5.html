        <h2>LGBTQ+ identities</h2>
        <p>For many years, the word "gamer" has evoked the image of a straight cis white male. Indeed, many video game communities have yet to live down their toxic, patriarchal roots. Yet, video game offer alternate realities that can appeal precisely to those marginalized because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Games with LGBTQ+ characters, themes, and communities have the potential not just to serve as an escape for the people they represent, but to proclaim their stories to a world that still doubts their humanity.</p>

        <h2>Feasibility of a web-accessible game-based intervention aimed at improving help seeking and coping among sexual and gender minority youth: Results from a randomized controlled trial</h2>
        <p class="details">James E. Egan, et al.</p>
        
        <p>Equally as important as changing perceptions about LGBTQ+ youths is helping those youths survive in a hostile world. This promising study used a superhero-themed RPG to demonstrate that video games are a feasible method of teaching healthy help-seeking and coping behavior to LGBTQ+ teens. Although these findings can't be generalized due to the nature of the study, the game was well-received among study participants and led to reductions in binge drinking, marijuana use, and cyberbullying victimization, as well as increased knowledge and use of online resources.</p>

        <h2>If Found...</h2>
        <p class="details">Dreamfeel</p>
        <p>The number of indie LGBTQ+ creators and games is countless, but this particular visual novel has risen to prominence for its deeply personal story and striking art. <em>If Found...</em> asks the player to "erase" the diary of a young trans woman named Kasio returning to her Irish hometown, as all the while a black hole threatens to destroy Earth. In a <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/if-found/if-found-review-an-essential-visual-novel/">review for <em>Pocket Gamer</em></a>, Cameron Bald sums up the game's power as "overwhelming empathy – the game's unconditional love for its people and setting."</p>

        <p class="details">Dontnod Entertainment</p>
        <p>It's only recently that commercial, mainstream franchises such as <em>The Last of Us</em> and <em>Life is Strange</em> have made waves by centering LGBTQ+ narratives. <em>Tell Me Why</em> joined their ranks by becoming the first AAA video game with a trans main character. Developed in partnership with an LGBTQ+ organization and featuring a trans voice actor, this narrative game tells the story of two telepathic twins who reunite in their Alaskan hometown.</p>

        <p class="details">PimpMySims4</p>
        <p>One often overlooked source of diverse content is user-created content or "mods." These labors of love often express a player community's unique interests, and LGBTQ+ game communities – which sometimes form around games with little LGBTQ+ content outright – are no exception. This mod of <em>The Sims 4</em> is one example that adds a plethora of LGBTQ+ related character traits, interactions, and events to the game.</p>
