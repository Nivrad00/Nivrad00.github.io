        <h2>What do games have to do with social justice?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Games are popular – <a href='https://www.theesa.com/resource/2021-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry/'>67% of Americans</a> play them</li>
            <li>Games can introduce players to experiences other than their own</li>
            <li>Games can be deeply transformative</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Video games are often written off as mindless fun. But like any other form of art – books, movies, or music – games can have purposes other than entertainment. These so-called serious games have been applied to countless fields, from <a href="https://superjumpmagazine.com/4-reasons-to-use-video-games-as-a-language-learning-tool-447d8010c0e2">language learning</a> to <a href="https://www.interimhealthcare.com/about-interim-healthcare/news-media/news-desk/video-games-being-used-as-physical-therapy-tool/">physical therapy</a>. But can they play a part in social justice?</p>
        
        <p>In short, games put players in other people's shoes. Through non-normative mechanics, narratives, and characters, games can provide a voice for those on the margins, and foster awareness and empathy in others. As a form of media with a broad appeal and a potential for deep immersion, video games are perfectly suited to nurture a more compassionate world.</p>
