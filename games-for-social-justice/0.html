        <h2>Why care about video games?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Games are popular – <a href='https://www.theesa.com/resource/2021-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry/'>67% of Americans</a> play them</li>
            <li>Games can be deeply transformative</li>
            <li>Games can introduce players to experiences other than their own</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Video games are often written off as mindless fun. But like any other form of art – books, movies, or music – games can have purposes other than entertainment. These so-called serious games have been applied to countless fields, from <a href="https://superjumpmagazine.com/4-reasons-to-use-video-games-as-a-language-learning-tool-447d8010c0e2">language learning</a> to <a href="https://www.interimhealthcare.com/about-interim-healthcare/news-media/news-desk/video-games-being-used-as-physical-therapy-tool/">physical therapy</a>. But can they play a part in social justice?</p>
        
        <p>In short, games put players in other people's shoes. Through non-normative mechanics, narratives, and characters, games can provide a voice for those on the margins, and foster awareness and empathy in others. Other games have personal uses, such as training for those with disabilities or escapism for those with marginalized gender identities. As a form of media with a broad appeal and a potential for deep immersion, video games are perfectly suited to nurture a more compassionate world.</p>
