        <h2>Disability and mental health</h2>
        <p>Characters with disability and mental illness have always existed in video games, but they are often harmful charicatures that misrepresent real communities – the psychotic villain, the blind sage, the dim-witted comic relief. Games in the modern age have the potential to take the step from awareness to acceptance, to challenge players to step into a different lived experience, as well as to help players come to terms with their own struggles.</p>
        <p>Due to scope constraints, this page focuses on mental rather than physical disability. Also not covered is the development of games for clinical use, although it is a rapidly growing field. Games have been used for the treatment of physical disabilities, chronic pain, PTSD, autism, anxiety, depression, dementia, and countless more.</p>

        <h2>Prism, a game to promote autism acceptance among elementary school students</h2>
        <p class="details">Ridima Ramesh, Xueyang Wang, Daniel Wolpow, Yidi Zhu, Yutian Zheng, Michael Christel, Scott Stevens</p>
        
        <p>This article describes the development of a game to help elementary school students empathize with their peers who have autism, in combination with a classroom discussion. This game uses animal characters to cleverly simulate experiences common to autism, such as sensory overload, preferring monologues over reciprocal communication, and difficulty multitasking. You can play the game itself <a href="http://prism.etc.cmu.edu/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Mighty Spoon: Representing characters with chronic health conditions in videogames</h2>
        <p class="details">Dakoda Barker</p>
        
        <p>This author relates their design process for creating three original games featuring characters with chronic health conditions (CHCs) – an often neglected and misrepresented community – and implications for future work. One of many conclusions is that by considering representation early in the design process, games can become more innovative, and better represent people's lived experiences.</p>

        <h2>Gaming with stigma: Analysis of messages about mental illnesses in video games</h2>
        <p class="details">Manuela Ferrari, Sarah V. McIlwaine,Gerald Jordan, Jai L. Shah, Shalini Lal, Srividya N. Iyer</p>
        
        <p>This analysis finds that portrayals of mental illness in commercial games are overwhelmingly negative and misleading. However, it ends with a hopeful discussion on the positive impact of games developed collaboratively with mental health professionals and those with lived experiences, such as <em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em> and <em>Debris</em>. It also describes games developed for clinical treatment like <em>SPARX</em>, <em>MindLight</em>, and <em>Reach Out Central</em>.

        <h2>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</h2>
        <p class="details">Ninja Theory</p>
        <p>Senua, the viking protagonist of this dark and poignant AAA-quality game, suffers from psychosis. Her condition is closely intertwined with the narratives and mechanics of the game, such as voices that whisper into the player's ears. Developed in collaboration with medical specialists and people living with psychosis, this game's nuanced and human depiction of Senua goes a long way to de-stigmatizing the condition.</p>
